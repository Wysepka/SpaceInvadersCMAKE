So this is a project with usage of cmake and SDL2 with submodules
Used eventpp for EventHandling: https://github.com/wqking/eventpp
Unfortunetly there is some error with CMake and SDL when trying to open files
This project is currently ditched until some resolution will come from SDL team

This project gave me a sense of feeling that making engines might not be for me,
and Gameplay / Tools Programming might be my gem :) (Well Engine programming too but maybe with better support)
